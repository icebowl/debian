Introduction

In this article we will look on how to automatically chroot jail 
selected user ssh login based on the user group. 
This technique can be quite useful if you what your user to 
be provided with a limited system environment and at the same 
time keep them separate from your main system. 
You can also use this technique to create a simple ssh honeypot. 
In this tutorial you will learn how to create a basic chroot 
environment and how to configure your main system's sshd to 
automatically chroot jail selected users upon the ssh login.
Creating basic chroot environment

First we need to create a simple chroot environment. 
Our chroot environment will consist of a bash shell. 
To do this, first, we need to create a chroot directory:

# ! * * * * * * * * * * * * 
# mkdir /SRV/chroot

In the next step, we need to copy the bash binary and its all shared 
library dependencies.
You can see the bash's shared library dependencies by executing the ldd command:

# ! * * * * * * * * * * * * 
ldd /bin/bash


Now, we need to manually create all necessary directories and 
copy /bin/bash and all libraries to the new chroot directory 
into an appropriate location:

# ! * * * * * * * * * * * * 
# cd /srv/chroot/
# mkdir bin/ lib64/ lib/
# cp /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.5 lib/
# cp /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 lib/
# cp /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 lib/
# cp /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 lib64/
# cp /bin/bash bin/


#!/bin/bash

I named this file : create-purple.sh
and issued the following command: 
./create-purple.sh /bin/{ls,cat,echo,pwd,bash} /usr/bin/vi /etc/hosts

#!/bin/bash

CHROOT='/srv/chroot'
mkdir $CHROOT

for i in $( ldd $* | grep -v dynamic | cut -d " " -f 3 | sed 's/://' | sort | uniq )
  do
    cp --parents $i $CHROOT
  done

# ARCH amd64
if [ -f /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 ]; then
   cp --parents /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 /$CHROOT
fi

# ARCH i386
if [ -f  /lib/ld-linux.so.2 ]; then
   cp --parents /lib/ld-linux.so.2 /$CHROOT
fi

echo "Chroot jail is ready. To access it execute: chroot $CHROOT"
