Setup  Configuration file: /etc/schroot/schroot.conf
    If you prefer separate configuration files, place them in /etc/schroot/chroot.d/. 
Example
A simple example that creates a chroot and installs <some-package> for an X windows environment. This is not the safest nor a standard way of setup.

Create root file system: 

mkdir -p /srv/chroot/sid-blue
debootstrap stretch /srv/chroot/sid-blue

Make a file /etc/schroot/chroot.d/sid-blue-schroot:

# schroot chroot definitions.
# See schroot.conf(5) for complete documentation of the file format.
#
# Please take note that you should not add untrusted users to
# root-groups, because they will essentially have full root access
# to your system.  They will only have root access inside the chroot,
# but that's enough to cause malicious damage.
#
# The following lines are examples only.  Uncomment and alter them to
# customise schroot for your needs, or create a new entry from scratch.
#
[sid-blue-schroot]
description=Contains the SPICE program
aliases=test
type=directory
directory=/srv/chroot/sid-blue
users=username (think about this)
root-groups=root
profile=desktop
personality=linux
preserve-environment=true



Where jsmith is an underprivileged user.

schroot -c test


apt-get update && apt-get install <some-package>
exit

As the user jsmith execute:

xhost +
schroot -c sid-blue

From this point the <some-package> could be used...

Or,

xhost +
SESH=$(schroot -c test -b)
schroot -r -c $SESH
schroot -e -c $SESH
